# Project Simulink Simulation Models

This folder contains the final version of the Simulink model for this project. The three subfolders represent three different simulation experiments:

## 📁 1. Speed and Current Control
**Full Name:** PMSM Speed and Current Dual Closed-Loop Control Experiment  
**Folder:** `Velocity Control`

## 📁 2. PWM Sampling & Updating Strategies
**Full Name:** PMSM Single Current Closed-Loop - Double Sampling/Double Updating and Single Sampling/Single Updating - Experiment  
**Folder:** `PWM Sample and Update`

## 📁 3.Complex Vector & Feedforward Decoupling Control
**Full Name:** PMSM Complex Vector Decoupling and Feedforward Decoupling Control Experiment  
**Folder:** `CV and FF Decoupling`
